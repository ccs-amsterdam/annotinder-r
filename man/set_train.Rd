\usage{
set_train(
  variable,
  value,
  field = NULL,
  message = NULL,
  submessage = NULL,
  damage = 0,
  operator = "=="
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{The name of the variable as used in the codebook. If not
specified, the name of the column will be used.}

\item{value}{The value to which the given answer will be compared. Either a
single string or the name of a column (in create_units).}

\item{field}{Optionally, the name of a field (in case of a field specific
annotation).}

\item{message}{A markdown string that will be displayed when the given
answer does not match value. If not given, the message will be: \code{"###
You gave an incorrect answer.\n\nThis is a **training** unit. \nPlease have
another look and select a different answer"}.}

\item{submessage}{An additional unit-specific message to display beneath the
general message. This argument takes an expression, so you can refer to a
column in the data (in create_units), and use other columns to create a
custom message.}

\item{damage}{The amount of damage a coder should receive. Can be a number or
an expression that returns a number.}

\item{operator}{How should the annotation value be compared to the column
value? Default is "==" (equals). Alternatives are "!=" (not equals), "<=",
"<", ">=" or ">".}
}
\value{
A list of training units
}
\description{
Setup training units, and provide the correct answers/annotations for these
units. If the answer/annotation is wrong, coders will see a message and need
to retry. Note that which units are train units needs to be indicated with
the 'type' argument in \code{\link{create_units}}
