\title{CrowdCoding ruleset}
\usage{
rules_crowdcoding(can_seek_backwards = TRUE, units_per_coder = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{can_seek_backwards}{Boolean. Should the coder be allowed to go back to
previous unit and edit them?}

\item{units_per_coder}{Number. The number of units presented to an individual
crowd coder}
}
\value{
A rules object
}
\description{
A ruleset that prioritizes coding the entire set as fast as possible using
multiple coders. When a coder requests a unit, the server will prioritize
units that have been coded by least other coders. After sorting by least
coded units, the units are presented in the original order as uploaded to the
server (i.e. the order used in \code{\link{create_units}}). Note that you can
use this to specify priorities, or to randomize the order.

## to create the rules argument in create_job
