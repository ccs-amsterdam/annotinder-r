\usage{
rules_fixedset(
  can_seek_backwards = TRUE,
  can_seek_forwards = FALSE,
  randomize = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{can_seek_backwards}{Boolean. Should the coder be allowed to go back to
previous unit and edit them?}

\item{can_seek_forwards}{Boolean. Should the coder be allowed to go forward
beyond units that have been coded?}

\item{randomize}{description}
}
\value{
A rules object
}
\description{
A simple ruleset that presents every coder with the exact same units, in the
exact order of units (as created with \code{\link{create_units}}). Note that
you can combine this with the jobsets argument in upload_job to specify
different fixed sets for different groups of coders. The order of ids in the
jobset unit_id will then be used.
}
\examples{
## to create the rules argument in create_job
rules <- rules_fixedset()
}
