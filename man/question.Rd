}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name/label of the question. Recommended to keep short. Cannot
contain a "."}

\item{question}{A short (think 1 or 2 sentences) question.}

\item{codes}{The codes that the coder can choose from. Can be a character
vector, named character vector or data.frame. An unnamed character vector
creates simple codes. A named character vector uses the names as colors,
either as HEX or a name recognized by browsers (see
\url{https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp}). A data.frame must
have a code column, and can use certain special columns (see details). For
most control, codes can be a list of 'code' objects created with
\code{\link{code}}.}

\item{type}{The type of question. Can be "buttons", "dropdown", "scale",
"annotinder" or "inputs". "buttons" shows all answers as buttons,
"dropdown" gives a dropdown menu with a search bar. "scale" is for ordered
buttons, and multiple items can be specified to answer this question for
each. "annotinder" lets users swipe for answers, and can only be used if
the number of answers is 2 (left, right) or 3 (left, right, up). "inputs"
can create one or multiple open input fields for text and numbers.}

\item{instruction}{Optionally, a markdown string with instructions for this
specific question. Coders can see these instructions by clicking on the
questionmark symbol before the question.}

\item{color}{If no colors are given to specific codes, this sets the default
color. Color should be HEX or a name recognized by browsers (see
\url{https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp}). If NULL (default)
the annotator client decides the default color.}

\item{fields}{Optionally, an array of field names (i.e. the column names used
in set_text, set_markdown and set_image). When the question is asked, these
fields will then be focused on.}

\item{per_field}{If a unit has numbered fields, the question can be
automatically repeated for each field. For instance, if "per_field" is
"comment", and the unit has fields "comment.1", "comment.2", etc., then
this question will be repeated for each comment. The easiest way to set
this up is to use the "split" argument in set_text and set_markdown, which
automatically split a field into numbered fields.}

\item{vertical}{If "buttons" selection is used, this puts all buttons on
the same row (just make sure not to have too many buttons)}

\item{same_size}{If "buttons" selection is used, make all buttons the same
size.}

\item{items}{Can be used for "scale" and "inputs" type questions. Should be a
named list where the names are the item names, and value is a list with
parameters.}
}
\value{
A question object, to be used within the
  \code{\link{create_codebook}} function
}
\description{
Creates a question that can be passed as an argument to
\code{\link{create_codebook}}.
}
\details{
Using a data.frame for the codes argument gives more flexibility.
  This data.frame should have a "code" column, and can in addition have a
  "color" and "parent" column The color should be a color name, either as HEX
  or a name recognized by browsers (see
  \url{https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp}) The parent column
  is only relevant if you have many codes and use selection="dropdown". The
  dropdown menu will then show the codes with parent names, and parent names
  are included in the search string. A parent can be the name of another
  code, and parents can have parents, thus creating trees (just make sure not
  to create cycles). Use case would for example be an ontology with actor ->
  government -> president, and issue -> economy -> taxes.
