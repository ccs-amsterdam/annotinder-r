\usage{
set_text(
  name,
  value,
  before = NULL,
  after = NULL,
  label = NULL,
  ...,
  offset = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the field. Must be unique within a unit.}

\item{value}{The content of the field. Can be given as a single string, the
name of a column in data (for create_units), or any expression.}

\item{before}{The text can have a context before and after the coding unit.
For example, the data.frame could be a keyword in context listing with the
columns "pre", "keyword" and "post" (see for instance quanteda's kwic
function). These could then be set to the "before", "column" and "after"
arguments, respectively. NOTE that if a before or after context is
specified, all other text fields before or after the current will also be
considered context.}

\item{after}{See 'before' argument}

\item{label}{An expression or character value to label the text field. Coders
will then see this label where this field starts.}

\item{...}{Style settings, passed to \code{\link{style}}}

\item{offset}{An expression (most likely a column). If the text is a part of
a bigger, original text, you can include the offset for the character
position where it starts. This is relevant if you want to import or export
span annotations for which the offset refers to the original text.}
