\usage{
jobset(name, codebook = NULL, ids = NULL, pre_ids = NULL, post_ids = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{String. The name of the jobset (e.g., experiment, control, set1, set2). Has to be unique across jobsets}

\item{codebook}{A Codebook. If empty, the default codebook in the codingjob will be used.}

\item{ids}{A character vector with unit IDs. If empty, all regular (i.e. not pre or post) units in the codingjob will be used}

\item{pre_ids}{A character vector with unit IDS for pre units. If empty, all pre units will be used}

\item{post_ids}{A character vector with unit IDS for post units. If empty, all post units will be used}
}
\value{
A jobset
}
\description{
A simple codingjob has a single jobset, in which all coders have the same codebook and use the same set of units.
With this function you can instead create different jobsets, that you can pass in a list to the jobsets arguments in \code{\link{upload_job}}.
}
\details{
To distribute coders evenly over the sets, each new coder will be assigned to the next set. When the last set is reached,
a new coder will be assigned to the first set and the cycle continues. In other words, a coders set is 'nth-coder modulus nr-of-sets'
If there are 2 sets, then coder 1 gets set 1, coder 2 gets set 2, coder 3 gets set 1, etc.
