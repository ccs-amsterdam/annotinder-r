create_units(
  data,

  id = "id",
  type = NULL,
  subfields = NULL,
  variables = NULL,
  meta = NULL,
  grid_areas = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame}

\item{...}{Unit content is specified using the set_ functions (set_text,
set_markdown, set_image, etc.). For example, if data has a column called
header, and you want to create a title using this column, use:
`set_text('title', header, bold=T, text_size=1.3)`}

\item{id}{Name of a column in data with unique values. These ids will be used
to link annotation to units.}

\item{type}{Name of a column in data with types. Valid types are: "code",
"train", "test" and "survey"}

\item{subfields}{Selected fields (text/image/markdown) of rows with identical
id's can be grouped together into a single unit. The subfields arguments
should then be a character vector indicating which fields need to be
grouped. Fields that are not grouped should have identical values across
all rows (with the same id). When fields are grouped, they are enumerated
as field.1, field.2, etc. This is particularly usefull when combined with
the per_field argument in \code{\link{question}}}

\item{variables}{A vector of column names in data. These column names can
then be referenced from the codebook. For example, if there is a column
"topic", you could ask the question: "is this sentence about {topic}". The
{topic} part will then be replaced in the question with the value for this
unit in the "topic" column.}

\item{meta}{A vector of column names in data. These names and their values
will be shown at the top of a unit. Can also be a named vector, in which
case the names will be used as the labels that coders get to see.}

\item{grid_areas}{A list with character vectors to specify the
grid-template-areas (see
\url{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas}).
Each item in the list represents a row, and each value in the character
vector the column in that row. The values need to be the names of fields
(i.e. the column names). If you want a position in the grid to be empty,
use a dot ".".}

\item{grid_cols}{A numeric vector of the same length as the number of columns
in areas. Each value indicates the relative space given to the column. So
c(1,2) means that the second column will be twice as wide as the first
column.}

\value{
A codingjobUnits object
}
\description{
Create the basis for a units object. The content of the units can then be
designed in a pipe of \code{\link{set_text}}, \code{\link{set_image}} and
\code{\link{set_markdown}} functions
}
