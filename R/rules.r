#' CrowdCoding ruleset
#'
#' A ruleset that prioritizes coding the entire set as fast as possible using
#' multiple coders. When a coder requests a unit, the server will prioritize
#' units that have been coded by least other coders. After sorting by least
#' coded units, the units are presented in the original order as uploaded to the
#' server (i.e. the order used in \code{\link{create_units}}). Note that you can
#' use this to specify priorities, or to randomize the order.
#'
#' @param can_seek_backwards Boolean. Should the coder be allowed to go back to
#'   previous unit and edit them?
#' @param units_per_coder Number. The number of units presented to an individual
#'   crowd coder
#'
#' @return A rules object
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' ## to create the rules argument in create_job
#' rules = rules_crowdcoding()

  }

}

#' FixedSet ruleset
#'
#' A simple ruleset that presents every coder with the exact same units, in the
#' exact order of units (as created with \code{\link{create_units}}). Note that
#' you can combine this with the jobsets argument in upload_job to specify
#' different fixed sets for different groups of coders. The order of ids in the
#' jobset unit_id will then be used.
#'
#' @param can_seek_backwards Boolean. Should the coder be allowed to go back to
#'   previous unit and edit them?
#' @param can_seek_forwards Boolean. Should the coder be allowed to go forward
#'   beyond units that have been coded?
#'
#'
#' @return A rules object
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' ## to create the rules argument in create_job
